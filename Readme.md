# Galaxy Gleam ☄️
A space-style arcade browser game!

[PLAY NOW: http://bit.ly/GalaxyGleam]

## The Game
Galaxy Gleam is a game played with the up, left and right arrow keys. As a meteor, dodge the asteroids and get your score high enough to rush into a new "world." The goal is to get the highest score as possible as you try to win (after the third world).

## The Team
I'm Saalik, the one responsible for writing the Typescript code for the game and coordinating much of the effort around the basic game design (physics, collisions, enemy types, etc.).

The graphics and a great deal of the game strategy along with myself was brought to Galaxy Gleam by my brother Kaamil. The art is hand drawn using a laptop-tablet hybrid.

All of the music is originally composed by Nabeel, our youngest brother. The sound effects are also his brainchild, as he used his voice, and objects around the house to create them.

All in all, this is a game made completely from scratch, helped by some pretty awesome brotherly teamwork. We're excited for lots of people to enjoy playing it!

## The Tools
To build the game on a technical level, here's what I used:

- Game Engine: [Phaser 3](http://phaser.io)
- Audio Engine: [Howler](http://howlerjs.com)
- Bundler: [Parcel](http://parceljs.org)
